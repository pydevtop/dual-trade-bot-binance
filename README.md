DualTradeBot is an intelligent trading system designed to automate P2P trading on Binance. It allows you to bypass restrictions and limits on card transfers that are in place in most countries, providing a convenient and safe experience

### How does it work?

You buy cryptocurrency - open a buy ad

The buyer places an order - the bot records their payment details (bank card number)

The bot creates a counter ad - using the buyer's payment details, the bot automatically places ads for selling cryptocurrency, and monitors all open orders, manages them, changes statuses and notifies you when it is necessary to release crypto on sell orders

Parallel transactions - buying and selling occur simultaneously, providing you with a profit without the need to make bank transactions from your accounts

Payment control - when the buyer transfers funds for a sell order, the bot notifies the seller from your buy order and automatically confirms the payment via the Binance API, informs the seller in the chat on the Binance website that you have already paid and need to release the crypto

Closing the deal - after the transaction is completed, the bot closes the sell ads, since they were created by the bot with the payment details from the buy order

 

### Key benefits

✅ Full automation – the bot monitors orders, managing the process without your participation<br>
✅ Real-time monitoring – tracking transaction statuses, notifications about key events<br>
✅ Flexibility – closing and reopening ads is carried out by the bot<br>
